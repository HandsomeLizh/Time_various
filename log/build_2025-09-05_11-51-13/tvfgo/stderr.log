[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:42 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindPC.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has asked
  CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "PC", but CMake did
  not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "PC" with any of
  the following names:

    PCConfig.cmake
    pc-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "PC" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "PC_DIR" to
  a directory containing one of the above files.  If "PC" provides a separate
  development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
