[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:52 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findirt_nav_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "irt_nav_msgs", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "irt_nav_msgs" with
  any of the following names:

    irt_nav_msgsConfig.cmake
    irt_nav_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "irt_nav_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "irt_nav_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "irt_nav_msgs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
